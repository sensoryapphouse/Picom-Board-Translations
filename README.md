Picom Board Translations

These are translations of the template boards used in PiCom.

They can be loaded into PiCom via the Import option in the settings menu.

They have been machine translated and would probably benefit from a native speaker editing them.

As they are machine translated we do not expect them to be perfect in any way, but hopefully they will provide a starting point for some users.
